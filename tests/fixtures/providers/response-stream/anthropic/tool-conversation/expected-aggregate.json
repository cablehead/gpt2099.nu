To create a backup, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Use a file system command to copy the file (like `cp config.json config.json.backup`)\n2. Or use a programming language or script to copy the file\n3. Or manually copy the contents to a new file\n\nWould you like me to help you copy the contents to a backup file manually? I can show you the contents I just read, and you could save them to a new file named `config.json.backup`.\n\nThe contents are:\n```json\n{\n  \"database\": \"sqlite://app.db\", \n  \"debug\": true\n}\n```"
